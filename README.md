## Objective
Create an interactive 3D scene with WebGL that showcases a personalized letter standing on an XZ plane, combined with lighting techniques from a designated light source.

## Approach & Steps
Document the strategy and step-by-step approach you took to achieve the objectives of the assignment:

### 1. Initialization & Basics
- Briefly describe how you initialized WebGL and any basic setup.
- Mention any issues or challenges faced.

### 2. Plane Construction
- Detail your approach to creating the XZ plane, including choosing dimensions and positioning.
- Include any challenges or deviations from the initial plan.

### 3. 3D Letter Construction
- Explain how you designed the 3D letter, from design considerations to the actual coding.
- Highlight any special techniques or challenges.
